# hello-world
This is my new github
This is the place where I learn how to use GitHub.
Oh what fun.

I don't know why there are colourful flags all over this office. I wonder if I have missed out on a party. I hope there are parties in this office very often. 
There are many many colourful sticky notes all over the office also. I would really like to know where the sticky note supply room is.
